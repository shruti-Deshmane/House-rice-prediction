# House-Price-Prediction
House Price Prediction using Linear Regression project.

# Project Overview  
This project applies **Linear Regression**, one of the most fundamental supervised machine learning algorithms, to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, etc. The goal is to build a model that can estimate the price of a house given its attributes. 
# Key Features 
Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data patterns. * Handled **missing values, outliers, and categorical features**. * Implemented **Linear Regression** from `scikit-learn`. * Evaluated model performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score**.

# Visualized predicted vs actual house prices. 

# Tech Stack  
Python Libraries:
 Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn 
# Dataset  
Source: Kaggle / Open housing dataset (can be replaced with your dataset). * Features: Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Floors, Location, etc. * Target: Price of the house.  
# Results  
The model achieved good predictive accuracy with Linear Regression
